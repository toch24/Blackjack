# BLACKJACK

Blackjack is a card game that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one (in our game the ace will count as an 11 if the total in the hand is less than 21). The objective of Blackjack is to the beat the dealer. This can be accomplished by getting Blackjack (first two cards equal 21) without the dealer having Blackjack as well, having your final card count be higher than the dealers without exceeding 21, or by not exceeding 21 and dealer busting by exceeding their card count of 21.

# HOW TO PLAY
The game starts when a player determines a buy in value. When a play button is clicked, a pop up will show up asking the user to determine the buy in value. The buy in value must be equal to or greater than 100. This will be the starting value for all players except the dealer. The house, or the dealer in this case will have a starting pot value of 3 times the buy in value.
